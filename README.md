## Philosophy

This blog embraces web minimalism. In an era of bloated websites and privacy-invasive tracking, pure HTML represents a return to the core principles of the web: universal access to information.

No build tools. No frameworks. No dependencies. Just HTML.

## Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

### 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
