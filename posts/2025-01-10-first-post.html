      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
      <p>Welcome to my new blog! This is the first post in what I hope will be a long series of writings about technology, minimalism, and the web.</p>

      <h3>Why This Blog Exists</h3>
      <p>I've been thinking a lot lately about the state of the modern web. Websites have become bloated with megabytes of JavaScript, tracking scripts, and dependencies. Loading a simple blog post can require downloading entire frameworks.</p>

      <p>This blog is my rebellion against that trend. It's built with nothing but pure HTML. No CSS, no JavaScript, no frameworks, no build tools. Just semantic markup that works everywhere.</p>

      <h3>Design Principles</h3>
      <p>Here are the core principles guiding this blog:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Accessibility First:</strong> This site works with Lynx, screen readers, and any browser ever made.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast Loading:</strong> Every page is just a few kilobytes. It loads instantly, even on slow connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Respecting:</strong> No tracking, no cookies, no analytics. What you read is your business.</li>
        <li><strong>Archival Quality:</strong> Pure HTML ages well. This site will work decades from now.</li>
        <li><strong>Keyboard Friendly:</strong> Navigate everything with just the keyboard.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What I'll Write About</h3>
      <p>My plan is to write about:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Web development and minimalist design</li>
        <li>Privacy and digital rights</li>
        <li>Open source software</li>
        <li>Technology philosophy</li>
        <li>Personal projects and experiments</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technical Details</h3>
      <p>For those interested, here's how this blog works:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Static HTML files served from a simple web server</li>
        <li>Each post is a standalone file with a clean URL</li>
        <li>Posts are organized by date and tags</li>
        <li>No server-side processing required</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>I'm excited to start this journey. If you're reading this in Lynx, w3m, or even a modern graphical browser, I hope you appreciate the simplicity.</p>

      <p>Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more posts!</p>
