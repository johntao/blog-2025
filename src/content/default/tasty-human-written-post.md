## Human vs AI First Impression!

Note: This post is written by me :D

I think the AI-generated one has already updated my current status (surprisingly!?) well

The first thing I notice is that they're good at capturing the keywords and expand it to a certain extent

That's to say, they're quite good at delivering popular science in an evangelist way

What I observed is that these generated articles are not so shy at repeating the same concept all over again

Whereas I as a human prefer my daily dose of random stuff.

Lastly, AI by default uses the different tone of language, I wonder if this is trainable.

For my preference, I love to deliver concepts in concise emotional or humorous words.

And I tend to keep it that way (not to train or prompt LLM too hard!) to earn myself a living ðŸ¤£
