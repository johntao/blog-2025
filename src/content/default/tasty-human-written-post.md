## Human vs AI First Impression

Note: This post is written by me :D

I think the AI-generated (first three) posts has already updated my current status well

The first thing I notice is that they're good at capturing the keywords and expand it to a certain extent

That's to say, they're quite good at delivering popular science in an evangelist way

What I observed is that these generated articles are not so shy at repeating the same concept all over again

In contrast, I, as a human, prefer my daily dose of random stuff.

Lastly, AIâ€™s tone differs from mine by default, but I wonder if it can be prompted to change.

I love explaining things in short, punchy words â€” with a bit of emotion or humor.

I tend to not prompt the LLM too hard, so my own voice can still make me a living. ðŸ¤£
