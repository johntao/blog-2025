There are so many words I can use to make my point directly:  
information explosion, tutorial hell, knowledge anxiety, imposter syndrome...

It is the phenomonon that you cannot simply keep watching technical videos on YouTube.  
(assuming your main information source is videos from any platform)

Sometimes you just need to turn off your brain to and watch cat videos or simply listen to some music.

Sometimes people get hype to the shiny trending stuff, but the hype doesn't prolong for numerous reasons.

Meanwhile, some unicorn startup just got their venture captial fund and drop off an awesome software  
that every influencers are talking about it, not to mention three more JS frameworks were released  
on the last month, and your tools used in the previous project is now officially outdated.

That's pretty much how information fatigue sounds to a regular developer.

What I as an ordinary developer could do is to find the balance between learning new things  
and consolidating myself.

This reminds me of the Chinese quote "Â≠∏ËÄå‰∏çÊÄùÂâáÁΩî, ÊÄùËÄå‰∏çÂ≠∏ÂâáÊÆÜ" from "Ë´ñË™û" which means  
"To learn without reflection is wasteful; to reflect without learning is dangerous." in English.  
Shout out to my friend Alvis for sharing the Chinese quote when I was confused to my career ü§úü§õ

Hence, it is wise to check all the information sources you used, and examine how you digest them,  
as well as what you feel about them.

Here I started my honest reviews to all the quality sources I have digged into:  
(listed by media platform, order by my use frequency descending)  
(p.s. I excluded Google Search and LLM intentionally, since they're just the entry point)

## Podcast (Fatigue Level: 1 out of 3)

This is the tranquil dojo for me to learn something new.

I always listening to podcast while I was commuting.

I felt like putting less efforts on learning things (i.e. no eyes needed), make it easy to sustain.

There were cases that I just want to listen to music or sing while commuting, otherwise, I seldom  
skip my news feed.

Name a few podcaster I am digging (no particular order):

- [Front-End-Fire](https://front-end-fire.com/): the lovely trio where they cover different types of news in the front end world
  - general big news, lightning news
  - new JS frameworks or tools
  - new web platform features
  - political affairs or dramas
- [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/): two cool dudes that I wish I could follow their successful paths
  - I loved their energy and their attitude of life in general
  - that's say I learned things other than development in this podcast
- [Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast): the professional podcaster
  - they are dedicated news podcaster. (in comparison: Syntax makes development courses)
  - you can feel the vibe of the industry through the commercial and the guests
- [.NET Rocks](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/about): the OG podcaster üí•üí• first episode was recorded in 2002 !!
  - they are the friendly wise elders we all need (I am in my 30s, btw)
  - time flies when they talk about the history of the IT industry (in a good way üé∑)
- [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/): the all-round (integrated) senior Microsoft developer one must know
  - he is proactively having conversations with different backgrounds people
  - listening to those conversation is always delightful and enlightening

## Videos (Fatigue Level: 3 out of 3)

This is probably the most addictived media for me to learn new things.

Easily hooked, and easily overwhelmed. Thus, I don't use this as my main learning source nowadays.

However, it is still fun to watch people sharing what's inside their Linux toolbox occassionally.

### Fireship 100 Seconds Secondseries

This one is so refreshing when it first came up in my feed.

I was surprised by the fact that a video of 100 seconds length can still be so much informative.

The content was legit, smooth and humerous in the same time that I cannot imagine myself doing
the same quality stuff.

## Discord (Fatigue Level: 1 out of 3)

My take on discord is that this is the place whenever I cannot find an answer myself on the internet.  

There were also discussion about how discord's content is not searchable on the internet. I don't have  
a solution for this either.

For me, I only join the servers that I am passionate to. Hence, I don't feel pressure playing around in it.

## GitHub (Fatigue Level: 2 out of 3)

[Topics](https://github.com/topics) and [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) are good place to discover things.

However, the amount of the information might be intimidating.

I cannot recall any pleasant memory of found out a hidden gem on the GitHub.

It is probably the fact that all the numbers are public to everyone.

One may imagine that YouTube creators are prone to be bothered by the view numbers than the visitors.

Although I mostly an open source user myself, I still find the numbers lead to anxiety in some degree.

The worries about not using the most legit tools, not being on the trends, afraid of being obsolete... etc.

Not even mention I also have a public GitHub page! üò®

## Internet Tier List (Fatigue Level: 2 out of 3)

Tier list are not for beginner to be honest. It's just a convenient way for pros to exchanging their opinions.

Knowing this fact might help people get rid off the anxiety hopefully.

## Developer Blogs (Fatigue Level: 1 out of 3)

It is the material I missed a lot because I don't read that much.

Now that I've started my 30 days writing challlenge, it would be interesting to read other developers' blog.

One can find developer's blog via the [uses tech](https://uses.tech/), or simply google search or ask LLM.  
p.s. uses tech is mostly front-end centric
