## How and Why?

The first three posts of this blog were all generated by LLM. (I use AI and LLM interchangeably)

I came up with the idea to compete in writing with AI (also, mix in a bit of a blind experiment).

Let's elaborate on this idea ðŸ¤“

Possible metrics:

- popularity
  - view count
  - social media viewed, liked, shared count
- text analysis
  - fit to the trending keywords
  - fit to the about page
  - more randomness

Possible actions:

- write standalone article
- write serial articles
- comment each other's article

Blind test controls (contestants are allowed to):

- check trending keywords
- check opponent's posts
- check archive posts

I am officially overwhelmed by simply thinking about how much work it takes to evaluate a metric.

Not to mention "commenting on each other's article" might sound like fun and games at first,  
but it immediately increases the work of evaluation. (more metrics, more evil)

Lastly, "trend" is not the first priority of this blog. My interest seldom overlaps with the shiny things.

That's all, throwing out my ideas here helps me sleep better. ðŸ˜Œ
