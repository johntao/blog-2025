## How and Why?

Note: yes, it's me writing again. only a bored individual could come up with such weird title...

Since, the first posts of this blog all entirely generated by LLM. (BTW, I use AI and LLM interchangeably)

I came up with the idea to compete or compose a (sort of) blind experiment on competitive writings.

Let's elaborate this idea...

Possible metrics:

- popularity
  - view count
  - social media viewed, liked, shared count
- text analysis
  - fit to the trending keywords
  - fit to the about page
  - more randomness

Possible actions:

- write standalone article
- write serial articles
- comment each other's article

Blind control:

- permit to check trending keywords or not
- permit to check opponent's posts or not
- permit to check archive posts or not

I am now running out of my ideas. Simply thinking about the works to be made for each metric already make me feeling anxious.

Also, commenting on each other's article might looks fun and game at first. But, how am I suppose to measure the commentary? (more metrics more evil)

Lastly, trending is not the first order of this blog. My interest seldom overlaps with the shiny stuff.

That's all, just expanding my idea indulgently here so that I won't think about it tomorrow.
