## Good News: Complaints Also Count

**Expected:** posting articles for 30 consecutive days  
**Actual:** defeated on the third day and started whining  

I was trying to post something constructive today â€” something about counting words recursively  
in nested folders on a daily basis, just to see how my laziness outperforms productivity.  

Meanwhile, I also planned to revive my un-bootable tablet today (solving a fossilized to-do is always good for mental health).

The takeaway is:

- I spent too much time installing Linux Mint on a dead Surface 3 tablet (which couldn't boot into Windows).
  - The only real technical issue was running `apt update` to get the audio output working.
  - The rest was just me being stupid.
- The LLM wasn't giving me the quality of code I wanted.
  - I tried prompting it with "implement it using the Unix piping philosophy,"
  - but the result was still far too verbose.
  - I finally got it right, but not before midnight.

## **END OF COMPLAINT**

Hope everyone enjoyed it ðŸ¤£. I'll try to post the word-counting script tomorrow.

*Teaser: it might be the most technical post I've made so far.*
