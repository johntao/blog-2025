## Good News, AI Are Not Allowed to Complain

Expected: straight posting articles in a 30 days streak

Actual: defeated in the third date and start whining

Just can't resist to the delicious complaint ðŸ¤£

I was trying to post something constructive today. Something about counting words recursively  
in a nested folders in daily-basis just to check how my laziness beats performance

The take away is:

- I spent too much time installing Linux Mint on a dead Surface 3 Tablet (unable to boot into Windows)
  - the only technical problem is to do `apt update` to make the audio output words
  - the rest of it was just me acting stupid
- LLM is not giving the quality code I wanted
  - I tried to prompt "implement it with unix piping philosophy"
  - but, the outcome is still way too verbose
  - I got it right in the end. But, cannot make it before the midnight

END OF COMPLAINT

Hope everyone enjoy it. I will try to post the words counting script tomorrow.

Teaser: it would be the most technical post ever made so far
