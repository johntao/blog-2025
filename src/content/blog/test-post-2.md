## Another Test Post

This is the second test post to further validate our Content Collections setup.

### Different Tags

Notice that this post has the `ai-generated` tag, which means it should appear in the AI-Gen filtered view.

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It should be styled differently from regular paragraphs.
>
> Multiple lines work too!

### Emphasis

You can use *italics* and **bold** text, or even ***both combined***.

### Links

Here's a [link to the Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build).

### More Code

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Technical Details

This post tests:
- Multiple tag filtering
- Tag-based post queries
- Different markdown elements
- Date sorting capabilities

### Wrapping Up

If both test posts render correctly and show up in the right places, we'll know the Content Collections integration is working as expected.
