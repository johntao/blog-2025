## Welcome to Test Post One

This is our first test post using Astro's Content Collections feature with markdown support.

### What This Tests

This post is designed to verify:

- **Markdown rendering** - Can we write in markdown and have it display correctly?
- **Frontmatter parsing** - Are our title, description, date, and tags being read?
- **Type safety** - Does the schema validation work as expected?

### Code Example

Here's a simple code block to test syntax:

```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello, Astro Content Collections!';
console.log(greeting);
```

### Lists Work Too

Unordered list:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Ordered list:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

### Conclusion

If you're reading this with proper formatting, then markdown rendering is working perfectly!
