## Welcome!

Welcome to my new blog! This is the first post in what I hope will be a long series of writings about technology, minimalism, and the web.

## Why This Blog Exists

I've been thinking a lot lately about the state of the modern web. Websites have become bloated with megabytes of JavaScript, tracking scripts, and dependencies. Loading a simple blog post can require downloading entire frameworks.

This blog is my rebellion against that trend. It's built with nothing but pure HTML. No CSS, no JavaScript, no frameworks, no build tools. Just semantic markup that works everywhere.

## Design Principles

Here are the core principles guiding this blog:

1. **Accessibility First:** This site works with Lynx, screen readers, and any browser ever made.
2. **Fast Loading:** Every page is just a few kilobytes. It loads instantly, even on slow connections.
3. **Privacy Respecting:** No tracking, no cookies, no analytics. What you read is your business.
4. **Archival Quality:** Pure HTML ages well. This site will work decades from now.
5. **Keyboard Friendly:** Navigate everything with just the keyboard.

## What I'll Write About

My plan is to write about:

- Web development and minimalist design
- Privacy and digital rights
- Open source software
- Technology philosophy
- Personal projects and experiments

## Technical Details

For those interested, here's how this blog works:

- Static HTML files served from a simple web server
- Each post is a standalone file with a clean URL
- Posts are organized by date and tags
- No server-side processing required

## Conclusion

I'm excited to start this journey. If you're reading this in Lynx, w3m, or even a modern graphical browser, I hope you appreciate the simplicity.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more posts!
