## Hello from Author 3

This is a sample post from the third author collection to demonstrate how multiple collections work together.

### Features Demonstrated

- **Multiple Collections** - Each author has their own content directory
- **Shared Schema** - All collections use the same post structure
- **Combined Listings** - Posts from all authors appear together
- **Individual Tracking** - Each author can be viewed separately

### Content Organization

With separate collections, you can:
- Maintain distinct content tracks
- Query one or all collections
- Apply different metadata per collection
- Scale to many authors/categories

### Conclusion

This approach provides flexibility while maintaining a consistent structure across all content.
